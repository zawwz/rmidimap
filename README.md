Map MIDI signals to command with a simple yaml file.

See [format](/FORMAT.md) and [examples](/examples/).

# Usage

# Features

### MIDI backends

Only Linux+ALSA currently.

### Device connection

Connect to devices by name, regex or address, and run commands on connect or disconnect.

### MIDI Event mapping

Define commands to execute on certain MIDI events

### Performance

rmidimap runs with very low processing overhead.
Processing overhead was measured at 100-200Âµs, while execution spawning was measured to 1-4ms.

### Command queue and interval

With the parameters `queue_length` and `interval`,
you can limit event throughput to reduce system load associated with the command being run.
